# Building
Just run the `make` command in this directory, and it should configure and build the libjpeg library and the main program.

# Notes/Requirements
This assignment is intended to compile on telsa or a linux system. You probably need to use MSYS2 for this to work on Windows. 
You need all the gnu/linux commands for this to work.

Also, I decided to use the libjpeg library to read and write .jpg files.

The jpeg-9c folder has all the source code for the libjpeg library.

This program links with the libjpeg library, so the library is necessary for the program.

If you have ANY questions, please ask me. If this program does not build or run, PLEASE ask me. If I get a bad grade on this because it does not compile/run, I  will ask you if you read this. I got it to run on Manjaro linux, and on Tesla.
