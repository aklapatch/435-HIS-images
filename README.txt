This assignment is intended to compile on telsa or a linux system. You probably need to use MSYS2 for this to work on Windows. 
You need all the gnu/linux commands

Also, I decided to use the libjpeg library to read and write .jpg files.

The jpeg-9c folder has all the source code for the libjpeg library.

Running `make` in this directory will build the library and the main program for you, assuming nothing breaks.
